# SimpleDay
This is a custom coding language/esolang that is built around python. It is also called SD by me, cause of course I'm too lazy to spell SimpleDay

#### To code in SimpleDay
This code language is symbolic and is right-handed (sorry for you left-handed users)

`/` | This represents a letter by count,  
`/ = a`, `// = b`, etc. This sets a character into the cell    
`n` | This represents a number by count,  
`/`, `n = 1`, `nn = 2`, etc. This also sets stuff into the cell
