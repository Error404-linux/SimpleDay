# SimpleDay
This is a custom coding language/esolang that is built around python. It is also called SD by me, cause of course I'm too lazy to spell SimpleDay

#### To code in SimpleDay
This code language is symbolic and is right-handed (sorry for you left-handed users)

`/` | This represents a letter by count. `/ = a`, `// = b`, etc. This sets a character into the cell.  
`n` | This represents a number by count. `n = 1`, `nn = 2`, etc. This sets a number into the cell.  
`[ or ]` | This changes the cell by one, no matter what. Can be used to create variables.  
`\` | Backslashs can be changed up to three, then it becomes unpredictable. 1 `\` prints the current cell, 2 of these `\` make a space and 3 make a newline
