# SimpleDay
This is a custom coding language/esolang that is built around python. It is also called SD by me, cause of course I'm too lazy to spell SimpleDay

#### To Use SimpleDay
If you want to add it into your computer to code in, you simply put it into this code into your path and have a 
        .day 
file extension and run it with that same file that is in your path.

#### To code in SimpleDay
This code language is symbolic and is semi-strict about how stuff is placed.

`/` | This represents a letter by count, so / = a, // = b, etc. This sets a character into the cell
`n` | This represents a number by count, so like `/`, n = 1, nn = 2, etc. This also sets stuff into the cell
