# SimpleDay
This is a custom coding language/esolang that is built around python. It is also called SD by me, cause of course I'm too lazy to spell SimpleDay
_____________________________________________________________________
#### To Use SimpleDay
If you want to add it into your computer to code in, you simply put it into this code into your path and have a 
        .day 
file extension and run it with that same file that is in your path.

#### To code in SimpleDay
This code language is symbolic and is semi-strict about how stuff is placed.
