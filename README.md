# SimpleDay
This is a custom coding language/esolang that is built around python. It is also called SD by me, cause of course I'm too lazy to spell SimpleDay

#### To Use SimpleDay
If you want to download the python interpreter from the website for use, you download the file, and put it into your system's `PATH`

If you want to use git, you can do the following on the line below:

#### To code in SimpleDay
This code language is symbolic and is right-handed (sorry for you left-handed users)

`/` | This represents a letter by count. `/ = a`, `// = b`, etc. This sets a character into the cell.  
`n` | This represents a number by count. `n = 1`, `nn = 2`, etc. This sets a number into the cell.  
`[ or ]` | This changes the cell by one, no matter what. Can be used to create variables.  
`\` | Backslashs can be chained up to 3. 1 `\` prints the current cell, 2 of these `\` make a space and 3 make a newline.   
`.` | This converts a number to a letter starting at 96, and yes, if you use a negative number, it will lower it by that number.  
`;` | The semicolon asks for an input, so please give it one, else it will hate you...  
`$` | This sign makes a comment. Why `$` instead of `#`? yes.  
`_` | This converts a number represented by n negative, or a character represented by / captial. Examples, `_n = -1`, `_/ = A`.  
`o/p` | This creates a comparison with a number stated to the current cell. o is <, p is >, or atleast I think. e.g. `o2`, `p3`.  
`+/-` | The `+` sign __ADDS__ 1 to the cell. The `-` sign __SUBTRACTS__ 1 from the cell.  
<N/C...> | These 2 symbols create loops, set by a number or cell at the start. [1] gets the value of cell 1, and 1 makes it loop once. e.g. `<1+\>`, `<[0]+>\`
